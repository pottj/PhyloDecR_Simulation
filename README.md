Simulation study to phylogenetic decisiveness 

Test random sets with n=6, 7, 8 taxa and compare speed and reply of Fischers Algorithm and the correct test (Four-way partition property). 

**Definition** (Four-way partition property). Let $S_n = {Z_1, ..., Z_k}$ be a set of quadruples of taxa set $X$, $\|X\| = n$. Then, $S_n$ satisfies the four-way partition property (for $X$) if, for all partitions of $X$ into four disjoint, nonempty sets A_1, A_2, A_3 and A_4 (with $A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup A_4 = X$) there exists $a_i \\in A_i$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$ for which ${a1, a2, a3, a4} \\in S_n$.
